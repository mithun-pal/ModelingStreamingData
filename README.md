# ModelingStreamingData
Key consideration of various attributes or qualities of Streaming Data while building a robust pipeline for it.  
This also explains some of the key concepts (__Late Data arrival, Fault tolerance, different Output Modes, Trigger__) in Solutioning major challenges associated with Streaming Data using Spark Structured Streaming API.  

Then it depicts this concepts by implementing a simple Vehicle's Over speed detector App using Spark Structured Streaming API. Where this demonstrate simple select, aggregate, Window operation, Watermark and checkpoint functionality.
